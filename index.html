            <div>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my
                    design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas
                    that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone,
                    I decided to look for some challenge,
                    something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers
                    (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface,
                    I really liked the idea,
                    but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                    problem.</p>

                <p class="textP">As designers,
                    we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look
                    perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>

            <p>The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to create a
                solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the result to the
                community.</p>
